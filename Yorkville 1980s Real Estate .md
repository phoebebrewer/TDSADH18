LIKE many parts of Manhattan, the area known as Yorkville finds that its distinctiveness as a neighborhood is fading.

''When you said 'Yorkville' it used to mean something,'' said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Democrat-Liberal who represents the neighborhood. ''But now it's just a physical place; the name doesn't mean much anymore.''

But perhaps because gentrification started in Yorkville decades ago, before there was even a word for the concept, the neighborhood seems to have developed resilience. In the face of the growth and development that have blurred the line between Yorkville and its glitzy neighbor to the south of 79th Street, the Upper East Side, Yorkville seems determined to redefine itself.

''It's an area that for a while lost its sense of community,'' said David Stern, director of the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association, a social agency that serves the area. ''One of the negative consequences of gentrification was that it completely tore the social fabric.''
But he thinks the fabric is well on the mend, and for that he gives much credit to the young urban professionals who, having settled in droves in Yorkville's new high-rises, plunged into the neighborhood's civic organizations.

They come to an area overflowing with new living space. A dozen new buildings with about 2,300 units have opened in the last several years, and Yale Robbins, the real estate research and publishing company, says that least 10 with more than 1,300 apartments are either on the way or proposed. Developers have marched the traditional northern border from 86th Street to 96th Street by convincing potential residents that the extra 10 blocks is the upper Upper East Side.

Residents can quickly enumerate Yorkville's virtues: the mix of people, the convenience of having ''everything at your fingertips'' and, especially, the pockets of Old World culture that survive from the time decades ago when Yorkville was a lively blue-collar community dominated by residents of German background.

The German presence in Yorkville dates to the late 18th century, when German immigrants settled near what is now 86th Street. In the early 19th century, wealthy New York families, including several of German descent, established country estates in the area; later in the century, the estates yielded to urbanization and were gridded into city blocks. German families then moved uptown from the Lower East Side, and in the peak years of European immigration, Yorkville became the destination for waves of immigrants, including central Europeans and Irish as well as the Germans.

Many ended up working in the area's breweries and frequenting the cafes, beer halls and social clubs along 86th Street. Before World War II, Yorkville was home to several pro-Nazi groups, including the national headquarters of Fritz Kuhn's German American Bund.
One of Yorkville's more famous residents, the late actor James Cagney, was honored last Tuesday when Mayor Edward I. Koch signed a bill designating East 91st Street between Second and Third Avenues as James Cagney Place.

YORKVILLE'S decline as a distinct enclave began with postwar real estate development on the East Side and was speeded greatly by the 1956 razing of the Third Avenue el, which removed a demarcation point between Yorkville and the silk stocking district to the west. The latest wave of development has inspired resistance by community advocates to what they describe as the ''canyonization'' of the area's avenues with high-rises out of proportion to the neighborhood's scale.

''I was standing at the corner of 88th and Third,'' said Carolyn Greenberg, who lives on 88th Street. ''The radio had said it was sunny. I couldn't tell.'' Ms. Greenberg, who is the new director of Reason (Rezone Eastside Arterials/ Save Our Neighborhood), advocates a ''short and fat, not tall and skinny'' approach to new buildings. Residents have been successful in getting midblocks on east-west streets downzoned, to maintain their residential character. The City Planning Commission is rezoning the 86th Street commercial area to require contextual development. The impact of replacing vacant lots and gas stations with multi-unit residences is evident in congestion on public transportation, and in the traffic jams on the avenues.

''Suddenly you have all these new buildings where people never existed before,'' said Tony Morenzi, an aide to Assemblyman Grannis. ''Nobody really knows how many people live here anymore.'' The count is made more difficult because in the new buildings, many young people share. At Normandie Court, where the campus-like atmosphere seems designed to ease the transition from college to adult life, studios start at $1,150 and one-bedrooms at about $1,295. Also widely available, for upwards of $1,200 monthly, are subdivided apartments in walk-up tenement flats once inhabited by local workers and their families.

Yorkville is no exception to the overall stagnant Manhattan co-op and condominium market, said Greg Young, the vice president for residential sales at J. I. Sopher, the real estate company. ''There's a lot on the market right now in Yorkville, with some good buys,'' he said.

Postwar one-bedroom co-ops west of York Avenue range in price from $200,000 to $500,000; new luxury condominiums range from about $160,000 to $300,000.

Only the enclave of East End Avenue is removed from the hurly-burly of transitional Yorkville. The prices on one-bedroom co-ops, which rarely turn over, range from $300,000 to $600,000. This is the neighborhood of Carl Schurz Park, one of Yorkville's few greeneries, where Mayor Koch lives in Gracie Mansion.
RESIDENTIAL development in the northern part of Yorkville has spurred a rejuvenation of stores along the avenues above 86th Street. Storefronts, some of which had been boarded for years, have suddenly blossomed into such restaurants as E'cco-la at 93d Street and Third Avenue, and video stores and press-on nail shops. Many small antiques shops in the neighborhood seem so far to have survived commercial rent increases.

What little is left of the German and Austro-Hungarian empire is evident on 86th Street, between Second and Third Avenues, where the Cafe Geiger and the Ideal Restaurant represent, respectively, the formal and informal approach to German cuisine. For Hungarian food, there is Mocca on Second Avenue between 82d and 83d Streets. It may say something appealing about the neighborhood that the health food store on 86th Street is boarded up, while the Marzipan Store next door seems to be thriving.

On East 82d Street, between Second and Third Avenues, are other reminders: the Puski-Corvin Magyar Konyveshaz, a Hungarian book and record store. Next door, is the New York Psychoanalytic Institute, where spiritual descendants of Sigmund Freud tend to egos and ids.

Religious institutions have played a major role in preserving Yorkville's cultures and in responding to need. Down the block from the Hungarian bookstore, on East 82d, is the Hungarian Reform Church, offering services in Hungarian.

Many churches and synagogues have food or shelter programs for Yorkville's estimated 1,400 homeless. The quiet garden and French Gothic-style architecture of the Episcopalian Church of the Holy Trinity, on 88th Street between First and Second Avenues, offers an unexpected refuge from urban life.

Yorkville is home to some of New York's elite private schools, including Chapin and Brearley, and at certain times of the day the streets are clogged with youngsters wearing prep-school plaid. Parents who cannot afford a prep school or do not choose to send their children to one have the choice of St. Joseph's Roman Catholic elementary school or Public Schools 198, 158, 151 or 190.

In P.S. 190, on 82d Street, between First and Second Avenues, is the Lab School for Gifted Education, an innovative seventh-and eighth-grade program. The Lab School has a computer link with Moscow school that allows students to do joint science, history and social studies projects.

Yorkville children who stay in the public schools traditionally go to Robert Wagner, the East Side's only junior high school, and on to one of the city's academic or specialized high schools. GAZETTEER Population: 68,200 (1985 estimate). Median 1-bedroom co-op price: $350,000. Median 1-bedroom condominium price: $230,000. Median 1-bedroom rental: $1,150. Transportation: Nos. 4, 5 and 6 subways; buses on 79th, 86th and 96th Streets and York, First, Second and Third Avenues. Government: Councilman Robert J. Dryfoos, Democrat-Liberal. First Branch: The Yorkville branch of the New York Public Library was the first of 39 branch libraries constructed in 1902 with money donated by Andrew Carnegie. The original facade survives, but the interior was modernized during a renovation three years ago and now, according to one neighborhood architectural critic, the Yorkville branch is ''Manhattan's first post-modernist library.''
