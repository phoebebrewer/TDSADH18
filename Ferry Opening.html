<h1>3,000 Children Help Hylan Open Ferry to Astoria</h1>
		
  
City - Operated Enterprise Wins Support of Business Men; Two Refitted Boats Inaugurate Service

		<p> 
    
<br>Mayor Hylan, accompanied by the
<br>heads of many of the city departments, 
<br>yesterday formally opened the munici-
<br>pally owned and operated ferry from
<br>East Ninety-second Street to Astoria.
<br>Civic and business organizations of
<br>Yorkville and Astoria, including 3,000
<br>school children, joined in the celebra-
<br>tion.

</p>

<p>

<br>Members of the Chambers of Com-
<br>merce of Yorkville and Astoria and a
<br>deligation from the Real Estate Own-
<br>er's Association of the 12th and 19th
<br>Wards met the Mayor and his official
<br>party at Pier A, Battery, and escorted
<br>them on board the sea-going tug John
<br>F. Hylan and the police boat Patrol.
<br>Accompanied by the reconstructed
<br>ferryboats Bowery Bay and Harlem,
<br>which are to be used in the new serv-
<br>ice, the official flotilla sailed around
<br>the end of Manhatten Island and up
<br>the East River to Ninety-second Street.
<br>All the way up the boats were greeted
<br>with the blasts of whistles from the
<br>river craft and the fire gongs along
<br>the shore were sounded.

</p>

<p>

<br>A parade was formed, headed by the
<br>Mayor, which marched through the 
<br>Yorkville section to the ferry house,
<br>where the Mayor brought the first ticket 
<br>on the reÃ«stablished ferry line. Prior 
<br>to the procession the city officials were
<br>welcomed by a committee of citizens 
<br>and were the guests at luncheon of the 
<br>Yorkville Chamber of Commerce. Jus-
<br>tice Robert F. Wagner, of the Supreme 
<br>Court, delivered a speech of welcome 
<br>to the city officials. Ralph A. Brown, 
<br>president of the Yorkville Chamber of 
<br>Commerce, presided at the luncheon. 

</p>
		
<p>

<br>The Yorkville section was gaily 
<br>decorated. School children along the 
<br>line of march sang as the procession 
<br>passed. The Mayor, Commissioner 
<br>Grover A. Whalen of the Department 
<br>of Plant and Structures who has 
<br>charge of the ferry operation; Borough 
<br>President Maurice E. Connolly of 
<br>Queens and other city officials dropped 
<br>out of the parade at Eighty-sixth 
<br>Street and Lexington Avenue and took 
<br>places in the reviewing stand erected 
<br>at that point. The parade reformed 
<br>after luncheon and marched to the 
<br>ferry house, over which Mayor Hylan 
<br>raised the flag of the City of New 
<br>York. He and his guests then went 
<br>on board the ferryboat Bowery Bay, 
<br>which made the first trip in the re-
<br>sumption of ferry service between 
<br>Manhatten and Astoria.

<br>The ferry was previously operated 
<br>by the East River Ferry Company 
<br>which ceased operation on December 
<br>31, 1918. The city bought the old boats, 
<br>reconstructed them, put the ferry 
<br>slips in good condition and is resuming 
<br>the service as a municipal undertaking.
