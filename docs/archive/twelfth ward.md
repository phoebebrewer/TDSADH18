**Our Police Force**
===
To the Editor of the New-York Times:

While the Police Commissioners are increasing the number of their force, why will they not give more protection to the residents of the Twelfth Ward? We have but two policemen from the North River, on the west, to the --, on the east, and from Seventy-ninth-street to One Hundred and Tenth-street, and this, in a District where there are more depredations committed than in any part of the Twelfth Ward. The station is at Yorkville, about three miles distant from that part of the District where policemen is most wanted. We want a substation on the Bloomingdale Road, near One Hundred and Fourth-street. It has passed the Board of Police Commissioners, passed one branch of the Common Council, and only wants a little of the energy of the Mayor to see that it is passed, and thus give to his constituents protection, and free us from the thefts of weekly and daily occurrence.
