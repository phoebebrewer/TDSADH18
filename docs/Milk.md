**<center>Milk.</center>**

*To the Editor of the New-York Times :*

  Not obtaining any satisfaction from the driver, I called on the owner of the milk wagon which delivers us our daily fluid. I said to him gold is fifty cents less than it was a year ago and feed is abundant and good, yet you charge your customers as much, if not more, for milk, as when the drought had nearly destroyed the pastures last Summer. To this he replied that the farmers were to blame, for they still kept up the old price. That the railroad companies charged one and a half cents per quart freight; and, queerest of all, that the cans usually ran six quarts short, it being the custom to buy by the can, which it was presumed carried the number of quarts called and paid for.
